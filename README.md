# MagicCap API v2
The job of this API is pretty much the same as v1 except for:
- Unused routes have been removed.
- Unneeded information is no longer stored.
- This uses DigitalOcean/Kubernetes/RethinkDB instead of AWS.
- It contains a WebSocket update manager.
- It uses Sanic.
- /travis is now /ci
